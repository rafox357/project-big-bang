# System Architecture

## Core Components

The Project Big Bang ecosystem consists of several key components working together:

### 1. Home Hub (Central Computer)
- Custom hardware designed for security
- Local AI processing capabilities
- Encrypted storage system
- Device management interface

### 2. Secure Operating System
- Custom-built for privacy
- Zero-trust architecture
- Secure boot process
- Application sandboxing

### 3. Integration Layer
- Standardized device protocols
- Security verification
- Data sovereignty enforcement
- Cross-device communication

## Security Architecture

Our security model is built on several key principles:

1. Zero-Trust by Default
2. End-to-End Encryption
3. Local-First Processing
4. Verifiable Privacy

## Data Flow
