# Project Big Bang 🚀

A revolutionary initiative to transform home computing and digital sovereignty through a complete ecosystem of secure, private, and interconnected technologies.

## Vision 🎯

Project Big Bang aims to revolutionize how people interact with technology by creating a comprehensive ecosystem where:

- Every home has its own sovereign digital hub with AI capabilities
- Users have complete control over their data and digital life
- Security and privacy are built into every component
- Technology serves people, not corporations

## Core Components 🔧

### 1. Home Hub
- Central computer system for managing your digital life
- Local AI processing capabilities
- Secure data storage and management
- Device integration and control
- Privacy-first architecture

### 2. Secure Operating System
- Built from the ground up with security in mind
- Zero-trust architecture
- Secure boot process
- Application sandboxing
- Privacy controls

### 3. Applications & Services
- Web applications
- Mobile apps
- Desktop software
- Cloud services (optional, self-hosted)
- Development tools

### 4. Hardware
- Custom-designed secure hardware
- Integration capabilities
- Privacy-focused components
- Open specifications
